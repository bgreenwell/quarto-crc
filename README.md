# A Quarto book example for Chapman & Hall/CRC books

This is a minimal example for those who plan to write books for Chapman & Hall/CRC using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/books/). The rendered PDF can be found in the `_book/` directory. Credit to @yihui for his [bookdown-crc](https://github.com/yihui/bookdown-crc) example repo based on [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/).


**TODO**

* Fix repeat ToC entries (i.e., Preface and References).
